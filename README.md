# survey_app

A survey hub for survey particpants involved in University of Guelph research data collection. This app streamlines
survey collection by giving particpants a container for all of the research surveys they intend to complete.

Users have the ability to create accounts with University of Guelph emails. Each user recieves survey data from a cloud
service upon logging into the app. The app allows users to track in progress and complete surveys through a convient UI.
The app will send notifications to the user once a week if they have outstanding surveys complete. Users also have acess
to a history log and a profile page where they can manage their account.
