# survey_app

A survey hub for survey particpants involved in University of Guelph research data collection. This app streamlines
survey collection by giving particpants a container for all of the research surveys they intend to complete. The app
allows users to complete the surveys on Qualtrics through a webview component in the app. Particpants also have a history
log containing information about completed surveys, and date/time information about surveys in progress.
